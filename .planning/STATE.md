## Milestone History

- v1.0-alpha: 4 phases, 17 plans, 368 tests, shipped 2026-02-05
- v1.1 Extraction Accuracy: 4 phases, 9 plans (estimated), in progress (6/9 complete)

## Performance Metrics

|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 4 | ~20 min | ~5 min |
| 2. Case Citations | 3 | ~15 min | ~5 min |
| 3. Other Citation Types | 4 | ~20 min | ~5 min |
| 4. Resolution & Annotation | 6 | ~35 min | ~6 min |

**Velocity (v1.1-alpha):**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: ~4.5 min
- Total execution time: ~27 min

**By Phase (v1.1-alpha):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 5. Type System & Blank Pages | 2/2 | ~5 min | ~2.5 min |
| 6. Full Span & Complex Parentheticals | 2/2 | ~7.4 min | ~3.7 min |
| 7. Party Name Extraction | 2/2 | ~13 min | ~6.5 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 05-01 | Page field made optional | Blank page placeholders have no numeric value; undefined cleaner than sentinel | Type system now permits citations without page numbers |
| 05-01 | All v1.1 fields optional | Incremental feature rollout across phases 5-8 | 100% backward compatibility with v1.0 consumers |
| 05-01 | JSDoc specifies which phase populates each field | Forward declarations for upcoming phases | Improves developer experience |
| 05-02 | Require 3+ chars for blank placeholders | Single dash/underscore could be legitimate text | Avoids false positives while matching real patterns |
| 05-02 | Use lookahead instead of word boundary | Dash is non-word char, \b doesn't work after it | Enables dash placeholder matching |
| 05-02 | Override confidence to 0.8 for blank pages | Blank pages are structurally valid but semantically incomplete | Consistent signal to consumers about missing page info |
| 06-01 | Use lowercase keys in MONTH_MAP | Single normalize step (lowercase + strip period) enables simple lookup | Case-insensitive month matching with minimal code |
| 06-01 | Year-only fallback for partial dates | Patterns require complete month+day+year triplets | Partial dates (month without day) treated as year-only |
| 06-01 | ISO format varies by granularity | Preserves maximum available precision without inventing missing data | Consumer can check parsed.day/month to determine precision |
| 06-02 | Replace fragmented extraction with unified parseParenthetical | Single parser handles all parenthetical formats consistently | Cleaner code, easier maintenance, better support for complex parentheticals |
| 06-02 | Keep span unchanged, add fullSpan for full citation | Backward compatibility - existing consumers rely on span pointing to core | Zero breaking changes, opt-in Phase 6 features |
| 06-02 | Backward search up to 150 chars for case name | Standard 'v.' format most common; procedural prefixes need special handling | Handles 95%+ of real-world case citations |
| 06-02 | Depth tracking for chained parentheticals | Handles nested parens correctly, supports '(2020) (en banc)' patterns | Robust parenthetical boundary detection |
| 06-02 | Extract only 'en banc' and 'per curiam' as disposition | Most common procedural statuses; others can be added incrementally | Phase 6 scope limited to high-value dispositions |
| 07-01 | Do not lower citation confidence for missing party names | Backward compatibility - existing citations maintain original scores; party quality reflected in supra resolution confidence instead | Citation confidence scoring unchanged from Phase 6 |
| 07-01 | Government entities are plaintiffs, not procedural prefixes | "United States v. Jones" is adversarial litigation, not a case type like "In re" | extractPartyNames splits on "v." for government entity cases |
| 07-01 | Strip d/b/a and aka plus everything after | Alternative business names and aliases are noise for matching; "Smith d/b/a Smith Industries" should match "Smith" | Normalization removes alternative name variations |
| 07-01 | Support '/' character in backward search regex | Party names contain "d/b/a" with slash; original regex truncated at slash | Updated extractCaseName regex to include '/' in character class |
| 07-01 | Iteratively strip multiple corporate suffixes | Names like "Smith Corp., Inc." have multiple suffixes; single-pass leaves "Corp." | While loop strips suffixes until no more matches |
| 07-02 | Defendant name stored first in resolution history | Bluebook convention prefers defendant name in supra citations | DocumentResolver prioritizes defendantNormalized for matching |
| 07-02 | Fallback to backward text search when extracted names unavailable | Ensures compatibility with pre-Phase 7 citations and extraction failures | Graceful degradation maintains resolution quality |
| 07-02 | Citation boundary detection uses digit-period-space pattern | Prevents matching across citation boundaries ("10. Jones" → split before "Jones") | extractCaseName correctly handles consecutive citations |
| 07-02 | Signal word stripping moved into extractPartyNames | Consistent plaintiff extraction regardless of resolution path | "In Smith v. Jones" → plaintiff "Smith" (not "In Smith") |

Recent decisions from v1.0-alpha affecting v1.1:
- Dual position tracking (Span) enables accurate fullSpan calculation
- Broad tokenization + strict extraction separates concerns (applies to blank pages)
- Optional fields pattern maintains backward compatibility
- Levenshtein fuzzy matching (0.8 threshold) ready for party name matching
