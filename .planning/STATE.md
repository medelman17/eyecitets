## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: TypeScript strict mode enforces type safety for complex parsing logic
- Phase 1: Zero runtime dependencies simplifies bundling and avoids supply chain risk
- Phase 1: reporters-db as data source ensures same data as Python eyecite
- Phase 1: ES2020 target enables modern regex features (lookbehind, named groups)

**From 01-01 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| PKG-01 | Conditional exports with types-first ordering | All consumers get correct IntelliSense |
| PKG-02 | sideEffects: false for tree-shaking | Smaller bundles for downstream apps |
| PKG-03 | ES2020 target for modern regex | Can use lookbehind for "Id." vs "Idaho" disambiguation |
| PKG-04 | Zero runtime dependencies enforced | Package adds zero transitive dependencies |

**From 01-03 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| TYPE-01 | Span interface with dual position tracking | Phase 2 text cleaning must build TransformationMap |
| TYPE-02 | Discriminated union Citation types | Switch statements on citation.type are compile-time safe |
| ARCH-01 | Three-layer position tracking architecture | Phase 2 implements clean → extract → translate pipeline |

**From 01-02 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| BUILD-01 | Manual package.json exports (no tsdown auto-generation) | Preserves types-first ordering from plan 01-01 for correct IntelliSense |
| LINT-01 | Biome noExplicitAny as error (not warn) | Prevents any types from entering codebase (critical for DX-02 requirement) |
| TEST-01 | 10-second Vitest timeout | Enables Phase 2 ReDoS performance validation (<100ms per citation) |
| TEST-02 | Exclude src/types/** from coverage | Type definition files don't need test coverage |

**From 02-01 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| CLEAN-01 | Simplified position tracking using lookahead algorithm (maxLookAhead=20) | Character-by-character diff handles multi-char deletions; conservative approach for MVP |
| CLEAN-02 | Default cleaners: stripHtmlTags, normalizeWhitespace, normalizeUnicode, fixSmartQuotes (not removeOcrArtifacts) | OCR artifacts less common; developers can opt-in when needed |
| CLEAN-03 | Conservative position mapping prioritizes correctness over performance | Phase 2 focus is correctness; Phase 3 can optimize if needed |

**From 02-02 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| PATTERN-01 | Broad patterns for tokenization, validation in extraction layer | Tokenizer finds candidates quickly; extraction validates against reporters-db |
| PATTERN-02 | Simple regex structure without nested quantifiers | Prevents ReDoS - all patterns <100ms on pathological input (validated: 2ms) |
| PATTERN-03 | Individual named exports (casePatterns, statutePatterns, etc.) | Better tree-shaking, clearer API, modular imports |
| CONFIG-01 | Add path aliases (@/*) to tsconfig and vitest config | Clean imports in tests without relative paths |

**From 02-03 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| TOKEN-01 | Synchronous tokenize() function | Enables both sync and async extraction APIs in Plan 6 |
| TOKEN-02 | Token includes only cleanStart/cleanEnd positions | TransformationMap (Plan 4) will map to original positions later |
| TOKEN-03 | Multiple pattern matches allowed | Extraction layer (Plan 5) must deduplicate and validate tokens |
| TOKEN-04 | Default patterns parameter concatenates all arrays | API is tokenize(text) for common case, tokenize(text, patterns) for control |

**From 02-05 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| EXT-01 | Year extraction before court extraction in parentheticals | Both court and year correctly populated from combined parentheticals like "(9th Cir. 2020)" |
| EXT-02 | Greedy reporter regex with numbers | Multi-word reporters like "So. 2d" and "F.3d" correctly extracted instead of truncated |
| EXT-03 | Neutral citations have 1.0 confidence | Neutral format is unambiguous; always maximum confidence |
| EXT-04 | Journal citations have 0.6 base confidence | Validation against database happens in Phase 3; Phase 2 only validates structure |
| EXT-05 | Safe position translation fallback | cleanToOriginal.get(cleanPos) ?? cleanPos prevents errors with incomplete transformation maps |

**From 02-06 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| PIPE-01 | Both sync and async API variants | Enables seamless transition when async operations added in Phase 3/4 |
| PIPE-02 | ProcessTimeMs tracked per citation | Performance monitoring for DX and optimization guidance |
| PIPE-03 | Warnings from cleaning layer attached to all citations | Preserves diagnostic context through pipeline layers |
| TEST-01 | Integration tests focus on MVP capabilities | Tests validate core metadata; parenthetical parsing deferred to Phase 3 pattern enhancements |

**From 03-02 execution:**

| ID | Decision | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|
| ANN-01 | Auto-escape defaults to true for XSS protection | Prevents injection attacks by default; developers must explicitly opt-out (safer than opt-in) |
| ANN-02 | Process citations in reverse order | Avoids position shift invalidation when inserting markup |
| ANN-03 | Support both callback and template modes | Flexibility for simple cases (template) and complex logic (callback) |
| ANN-04 | Position map tracks original→new positions | Enables external systems to sync indices after annotation |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research (SUMMARY.md):**
- Phase 1: Regex pattern audit needed — inventory all Python eyecite patterns, flag ES incompatibilities
- Phase 1: Bundle strategy decision required — inline vs. tree-shake vs. CDN for reporters (affects architecture)
- Phase 2: ReDoS testing infrastructure — integrate analyzer, establish baseline (<100ms per citation) ✅ Done (02-02)
- Phase 3: Reporter database optimization — measure tree-shaking vs. compression trade-offs with actual bundle
- Phase 3: Position accuracy validation — requires access to diverse legal document corpus with HTML/Unicode

**From 02-06 execution:**
- Parenthetical extraction (court, year) requires enhanced patterns with ReDoS protection — Phase 3 should add optional parenthetical matching
- Duplicate citation filtering (overlapping pattern matches) deferred to Phase 3 annotation layer
- Unicode position accuracy edge cases (emoji, combining characters, RTL) need validation corpus in Phase 3
