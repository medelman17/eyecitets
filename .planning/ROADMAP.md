### 🚧 v1.1 Extraction Accuracy (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Improve citation extraction accuracy with full spans, party names, parallel citation linking, blank page support, and complex parentheticals

#### Phase 5: Type System & Blank Pages
**Goal**: Extend type system with optional fields and support blank page placeholders
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (v1.0-alpha complete)
**Requirements**: QUAL-01, BLANK-01, BLANK-02, BLANK-03, BLANK-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Citation types accept optional fullSpan, caseName, plaintiff, defendant, hasBlankPage, and structured date fields
  2. Citations with blank page numbers (underscores or dashes) are extracted with hasBlankPage flag
  3. Blank page citations have undefined page field and confidence 0.8
  4. All existing tests pass unchanged (backward compatibility verified)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01: TBD
- [ ] 05-02: TBD

#### Phase 6: Full Span & Complex Parentheticals
**Goal**: Extract full citation boundaries and parse complex parentheticals with dates
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: SPAN-01, SPAN-02, SPAN-03, SPAN-04, PAREN-01, PAREN-02, PAREN-03, PAREN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Case citations include fullSpan covering case name through closing parenthetical
  2. Case name is extracted via backward search for "v." pattern and exposed in caseName field
  3. Existing span field unchanged (core only) for backward compatibility
  4. Parentheticals containing month/day dates extract court and structured date (year, month, day)
  5. Parentheticals work correctly with court only, date only, or both
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: TBD
- [ ] 06-02: TBD
- [ ] 06-03: TBD

#### Phase 7: Party Name Extraction
**Goal**: Extract plaintiff and defendant from case names for improved supra resolution
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: PARTY-01, PARTY-02, PARTY-03, PARTY-04, PARTY-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Citations expose plaintiff and defendant fields split on "v." / "vs."
  2. Procedural prefixes (In re, Ex parte, Matter of) handled correctly with plaintiff only
  3. Government entities like "United States" recognized as plaintiffs
  4. Supra resolution uses party names for improved matching (fixes #21)
  5. Confidence scoring reflects party name extraction quality
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 07-01: TBD
- [ ] 07-02: TBD

#### Phase 8: Parallel Linking & Quality Validation
**Goal**: Link parallel citations sharing a parenthetical and validate quality targets
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: PARA-01, PARA-02, PARA-03, PARA-04, SPAN-05, QUAL-02, QUAL-03, QUAL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Comma-separated case citations sharing a parenthetical are linked via parallelCitations array
  2. All citations returned individually (backward compatible)
  3. No false positives in parallel linking (proximity and shared context required)
  4. Annotation supports full span mode (annotate from case name through parenthetical)
  5. Bundle size remains under 50KB gzipped
  6. Performance remains under 100ms for 10KB documents
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: TBD
- [ ] 08-02: TBD
