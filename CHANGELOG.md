## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#70](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/70) [`9acdc81`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/9acdc81954bdf23b4f2c07f89e860777effe7c43) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Add Illinois ILCS chapter-act citation extraction and remove legacy state-code pattern.

  - New `chapter-act` pattern and `extractChapterAct` extractor for "735 ILCS 5/2-1001" format
  - Removed broad `state-code` pattern — fully superseded by named-code + abbreviated-code families
  - Eliminates duplicate citation output for state codes that previously matched both patterns

- [#69](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/69) [`4efd7fc`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/4efd7fc11bb21e8e307aa09856614a71be641510) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Add state statute citation extraction for 19 jurisdictions across three pattern families:

  **Federal (PR #67):** Enhanced USC/CFR patterns with subsection capture, et seq., §§ ranges. Added prose-form "section X of title Y". Refactored extractStatute into dispatcher architecture.

  **Abbreviated-code (PR #68):** Added knownCodes registry and extraction for 12 states using compact abbreviations: FL, OH, MI, UT, CO, WA, NC, GA, PA, IN, NJ, DE.

  **Named-code (PR #69):** Added extraction for 7 states using jurisdiction prefix + code name: NY (21 laws), CA (29 codes), TX (29 codes), MD (36 articles), VA, AL, MA (chapter-based).

  New `StatuteCitation` fields: `subsection`, `jurisdiction`, `pincite`, `hasEtSeq`. Shared `parseBody` helper for section/subsection/et seq splitting. ~970 tests (up from 528).

### Patch Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/64) [`a128e50`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/a128e50a94c96bba76450b7306fdc6fa2ea76598) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix lookahead pattern bugs #52 and #53 that prevented year extraction:

  - **Bug #52**: Fixed footnote reference (n.3) preventing year extraction - updated lookahead pattern to skip optional footnote markers like "n.3" or "note 7"
  - **Bug #53**: Fixed pincite ranges (152-53, 163-64) preventing year extraction - updated lookahead pattern to handle hyphenated ranges and multiple comma-separated pincites

  These fixes improve year extraction accuracy for citations with complex pincite formats, promoting 2 test cases from known limitations to passing tests.

- [#65](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/65) [`62578d7`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/62578d7ff662d1e964be62e7cbae5798eaf10ad2) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix multi-word state reporters bug #45 that prevented matching reporters like "Ohio St. 3d" and "Md. App.":

  - **Bug #45**: Updated state-reporter pattern to allow spaces and digits in reporter names while excluding journal patterns
  - Pattern now uses negative lookahead `(?! L\.[JQR\s])` to prevent misclassifying journal citations like "Yale L.J." as case citations
  - Promotes 2 test cases from known limitations to passing tests

  This fix improves tokenization accuracy for state reporters with multi-word names and ensures journal citations remain correctly classified.

- [#66](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/66) [`4c26c7b`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/4c26c7b6237ac300d07a2ad79c1e50da0138099b) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix neutral citation type classification bugs #50 and #51:

  - **Bug #50**: State vendor-neutral citations like "2007 UT 49", "2017 WI 17", "2013 IL 112116" now correctly classified as "neutral" type instead of "case"

    - Added state-vendor-neutral pattern: YYYY STATE_CODE NUMBER
    - Pattern runs before case patterns in extraction pipeline, ensuring correct type assignment

  - **Bug #51**: U.S. App./Dist. LEXIS citations like "2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 12345" and "2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67890" now matched as neutral citations
    - Expanded LEXIS pattern to include optional "App." and "Dist." court identifiers
    - Updated extraction regex to handle variable court formats

  Promotes 7 test cases from known limitations to passing tests. Improves accuracy for state and federal neutral citation extraction.

- [#63](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/63) [`8485b1d`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/8485b1de31c827ce58e7ac502dbc2b2803da6a46) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix four tokenization pattern bugs discovered during corpus testing:

  - **Bug #44**: Added F. App'x (Federal Appendix) support - added apostrophe variant to federal-reporter pattern and updated extraction regex
  - **Bug #46**: Added USC without periods support - pattern now matches both "U.S.C." and "USC"
  - **Bug #47**: Added C.F.R. (Code of Federal Regulations) pattern - new statute pattern for CFR citations
  - **Bug #48**: Made "No." optional in Public Law citations - pattern now matches both "Pub. L. No." and "Pub. L."

  These fixes promote 4 test cases from known limitations to passing tests, improving extraction coverage for federal citations with variant formats.

- [#61](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/61) [`61152d1`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/61152d1aeea7eeb16823840e3b9d72ec7d7bea4e) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix three quick-win bugs discovered during corpus testing:

  - **Bug #43**: Fixed `§§` (double section symbol) crashing extractStatute by updating regex to accept one or more section symbols
  - **Bug #55**: Added HTML entity decoding (`&sect;` → §, `&amp;` → &, etc.) to cleaning pipeline
  - **Bug #54**: Added Unicode dash normalization (en-dash/em-dash → ASCII hyphen) to cleaning pipeline

  These fixes promote 3 test cases from known limitations to passing tests, improving extraction accuracy for real-world legal documents with HTML entities and Unicode punctuation.

  - Split case names on "v."/"vs." into `plaintiff` and `defendant` fields with raw text preserved
  - Normalized fields (`plaintiffNormalized`, `defendantNormalized`) strip et al., d/b/a, aka, corporate suffixes, and leading articles
  - Procedural prefix detection (In re, Ex parte, Matter of, etc.) with `proceduralPrefix` field
  - Government entities (United States, People, Commonwealth, State) recognized as plaintiffs, not procedural prefixes
  - Supra resolution uses extracted party names for higher-accuracy matching before Levenshtein fallback
  - Defendant name prioritized in resolution history per Bluebook convention
  - All new fields optional — zero breaking changes for existing consumers

- [#41](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/41) [`fb18be2`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/fb18be281b3835e90d46ad2e5e3e2229c6e43667) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Link parallel citations into groups and add full-span annotation mode

  - Detect comma-separated case citations sharing a parenthetical as parallel citations
  - `groupId` field identifies citation groups, `parallelCitations` array on primary citation references secondaries
  - All citations still returned individually for backward compatibility
  - `useFullSpan` annotation option to annotate from case name through closing parenthetical
  - Golden test corpus with 28 real-world samples for regression testing

### Patch Changes

- [#42](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/42) [`5e8544b`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/5e8544ba271bc73545bb9fc877dd636f9a301dba) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Improve extraction performance with TypeScript-specific optimizations

  This release includes three performance optimizations that significantly speed up citation extraction:

  **Regex Compilation Hoisting:** Moved 11 frequently-used regex patterns from inline definitions to module-level constants, eliminating redundant compilations (5-10ms savings per document).

  **Deduplication Bitpacking:** Optimized token deduplication by using bitpacked integers instead of string concatenation for Set keys in typical documents (<65KB), with automatic fallback for larger documents (2-5ms savings).

  **Parallel Detection Early Exit:** Added distance-based early exit in parallel citation detection to skip expensive validation when tokens are too far apart, reducing algorithmic complexity from O(n²) to O(n×k) (3-8ms savings).

  **Expected impact:** 20-60% performance improvement on typical 10KB legal documents (from <49ms to 19-39ms baseline). All optimizations are transparent to consumers with zero breaking changes.

Volume type changed from `number` to `number | string` across all citation types — numeric volumes remain numbers, hyphenated volumes are strings.

- [#26](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/26) [`18ae4c2`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/18ae4c2f19af46ce9b89a72f9061b5133d4816f3) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Add `statutesAtLarge` citation type for Statutes at Large references (e.g., "124 Stat. 119"). Previously these were misclassified as case citations via the broad state-reporter pattern.

### Patch Changes

- [#24](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/24) [`0a064ed`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/0a064edcc132df16f7a1a8a8440915660f64ee3d) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Add support for 4th and 5th series reporters in case citation patterns

- [#29](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/29) [`fb1e58f`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/fb1e58f674e3a443c6b1f594fd258f3ab33b572c) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix compact journal citations (e.g., "93 Harv.L.Rev. 752") being misclassified as case citations. Added a specific pattern for compact law review abbreviations containing L.Rev., L.J., or L.Q. that runs before the broad state-reporter case pattern.

- [#35](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/35) [`14320ad`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/14320ad56e9b639ec6ea33e6babc2dcf48776b8a) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix annotation markers being inserted inside HTML tags when mapping back to original text

- [#34](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/34) [`195403e`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/195403e737e820ae89cc0d38805719806b10d022) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix court extraction when parenthetical contains month/day date (e.g., "(2d Cir. Jan. 15, 2020)")

- [#31](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/31) [`77f30ce`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/77f30ce22ad6a81398cb6e59e9f6ac593e5cc972) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix year and court not extracted from parentheticals on full case citations. The extractor now looks ahead in the cleaned text for trailing parentheticals like `(1989)` or `(9th Cir. 2020)`. Also strips year from court field and infers `scotus` for Supreme Court reporters.

- [#33](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/33) [`c05948b`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/c05948b9833c0bdb564abdcba412928b6711e46e) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix supra resolution failing when antecedent citation is preceded by signal words (In, See, Compare, etc.)

- [#30](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/30) [`70d70a7`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/70d70a76866964be98871cd98ae69074da63fb57) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix "U. S." (with internal space) not being recognized as a Supreme Court reporter. Added optional whitespace between "U." and "S." in the supreme-court tokenization pattern.

- [#27](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/27) [`6fa73a8`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/6fa73a816e3cdc20d91ab56f9bcf6a4b7d1d80bf) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix statute sections with trailing letters (e.g., "18 U.S.C. § 1028A") not being recognized. Updated tokenization patterns for both USC and state code statutes to allow alphanumeric section suffixes.

- [#28](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/pull/28) [`dba6092`](https://github.com/medelman17/eyecite-ts/commit/dba609256eec9a0007223de88b8bd8504bd64dc4) Thanks [@medelman17](https://github.com/medelman17)! - Fix supra pattern failing when a space precedes the comma (e.g., "Twombly , supra"), which occurs when HTML tags are cleaned from text like `<em>Twombly</em>, supra`.
