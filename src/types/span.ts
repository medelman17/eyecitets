/**
 * Represents a text span with positions tracked through transformations.

 * During text cleaning (HTML removal, whitespace normalization), positions
 * shift. Span tracks BOTH cleaned positions (for parsing) and original
 * positions (for user-facing results).
 *
 * @example
 * const original = "Smith v. Doe, 500 F.2d 123 (2020)"
 * // After cleaning, positions may shift
 * const span: Span = {
 *   cleanStart: 14,  // Position in cleaned text
 *   cleanEnd: 27,
 *   originalStart: 14,  // Position in original text
 *   originalEnd: 27
 * }
