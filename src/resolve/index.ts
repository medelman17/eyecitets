/**
 * Citation Resolution
 *
 * Resolves short-form citations (Id./supra/short-form case) to their full antecedents.

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { resolveCitations } from 'eyecite-ts/resolve'
 * import { extractCitations } from 'eyecite-ts'
 *
 * const text = 'See Smith v. Jones, 500 F.2d 100 (1974). Id. at 105.'
 * const citations = extractCitations(text)
 * const resolved = resolveCitations(citations, text)
 *
 * // resolved[1] is Id. citation with resolution.resolvedTo = 0
 * console.log(resolved[1].resolution?.resolvedTo) // 0 (points to Smith v. Jones)
 * ```
